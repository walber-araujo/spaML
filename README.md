# 🚀 spaML - Spam Classifier in Haskell

spaML is a spam message classifier developed in **Haskell**, using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm to categorize messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam).

## 🛠️ Features
✅ Model training from CSV files  
✅ Reuse of previously trained models  
✅ Removal of user-trained models (default models cannot be deleted)  
✅ Manual training  
✅ Classification of individual messages  
✅ Display of accuracy metrics of trained models  
✅ Interactive interface via command line (CLI)

## 🖥️ Usage

### 📌 CLI Options:
| Option | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **1** | Reuse previous models |
| **2** | Add new model |
| **3** | Remove a model |
| **4** | Train model manually |
